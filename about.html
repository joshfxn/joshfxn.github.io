    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>I've been in the Information Technology sector since the early 1990's. During my time I've dealt with customers
      covering everything from Y2K concerns, certification paths, Identity Management and most recently custom
      automation.
      My team is currently responsible for handling the automation for internal processes within the Rackspace public
      cloud
      offerings. I'm mainly responsible for the development of API's and PowerShell modules.</p>

      <strong>DevOps Engineer IV (Implementation Automation)</strong>

      <em>January 2022 - Present</em>
      <br />
      <div id="Summary">
        <p>As a member of this small team our responsibility was to consolidate the build process across all public
          clouds for Rackspace. Each team would get design specifications for a customer build in differing formats and
          with differing levels of information. This created disparity between builds in the clouds and even within the
          same product at times. We had a handful of goals to address this issue:
          <ul>
            <li>Standardize Design Documents</li>
            <li>Create a process to automate the build</li>
            <li>Standardize on a single templating language</li>
            <li>Reduce build times globally</li>
            <li>Make the build an artifact to be handed over</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <div id="Summary">
        <p>As a technical trainer at Bryan College I was expected to develop and work with Microsoft Curriculum to build solid foundations
          for my students to become successful IT workers. While we focused on certification for each student we were also focused on each
          student being able to move into the workplace and succeed. So in addition to writing curriculum and working on lesson plans and
          developing lab work and tests, we also worked with the students in social aspects of a job interview.
